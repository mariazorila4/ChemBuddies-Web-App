# ChemBuddies: The Cute Periodic Table

## Project Focus: Knowledge & Education (Chemistry) 

This is a fun, interactive web application designed to help students learn the basic facts about 
the first 20 chemical elements in the Periodic Table. 
The goal was to make learning engaging and memorable within a very short timeframe. 

## Key Features: 
1. Cute Mascots: Each of the 20 elements is represented by a unique, adorable character 
(an image file) to create an instant visual connection. 
2. Interactive Cards: Clicking an element reveals a pop-up with its essential data (Symbol, 
Atomic Number) and a funny, punchy description related to its real-world properties. 
3. Simple Design: Built with basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring a clean, easy-to
use interface with a "cute and colorful" pastel theme.

## Future features
Future development will focus on incorporating the entire periodic table and implementing a robust database solution, such as PostgreSQL or SQLite, for efficient data management. A key feature will be the introduction of a module to calculate and balance chemical reaction equations, enabling users to apply these directly to problem-solving. The goal is to significantly enhance the interactivity of high school chemistry education.
