# üß™ChemBuddies: The Cute Periodic Table‚öóÔ∏è

### Context: Cursor Hackathon Projectüíª

  This project was rapidly developed in just 3 hours during the **Cursor Hackathon**. 
  
  ***Hackathon Motto:** "A simple, working prototype is always better than a complex, unfinished idea."*
  
   As a beginner developer, the time constraint and the scope of the event posed a significant challenge. While many participants created highly complex applications, the goal for ChemBuddies was to execute a **Minimum Lovable Product (MLP)**. This meant focusing strictly on UI/UX and core presentation for a small subset of data, allowing me to deliver a complete, polished front-end experience that serves as a solid foundation for future, more complex development (as detailed in the *Future Features* section).

## Project Focus: Knowledge & Education (Chemistry)‚öõÔ∏è 

This is a fun, interactive web application designed to help students learn the basic facts about 
the first 20 chemical elements in the Periodic Table. 
The goal was to make learning engaging and memorable within a very short timeframe. 

## ‚ú®Key Features: 
***1. Cute Mascots:*** Each of the 20 elements is represented by a unique, adorable character 
(an image file) to create an instant visual connection for learning.

***2. Interactive Cards (static data):*** Clicking on an element triggers a pop-up (modal) that displays key static data like symbol, atomic number, the element's specific mascot and a funny, descriptive punchline related to its real-world properties.

***3. Simple Design:*** Built with basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring a clean, lightweight, and easy-to use interface with a "cute and colorful" pastel theme.

## ‚öôÔ∏èSetup instructions

As this is a static web application, no server-side setup or dependencies are required.

**1. Clone the repository:**
git clone https://github.com/mariazorila4/ChemBuddies-Web-App.git

**2. Open the application:** Navigate to the project folder and open the [*index.html*](https://github.com/mariazorila4/ChemBuddies-Web-App/blob/main/src/index.html) file directly in your web browser.

## üìàFuture features
Future development will focus on transitioning this static UI/UX prototype into a robust, fully functional educational platform.

- **Full Periodic Table:** Incorporate all known chemical elements.
- **Database Integration:** Migrate element data from hard-code JavaScript array to a reliable database solution (e.g. PostgreSQL, SQLite or MongoDB) for efficient management.
- **Advanced Module:** Introduction of a key educational feature to calculate and balance chemical reaction equations, allowing users to apply chemical principles directly.
- **User Accounts:** Allow users to save progress and track favorite elements.

The goal is to significantly enhance the interactivity of high school chemistry education.
